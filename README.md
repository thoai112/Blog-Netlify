## Serverless Method

With this serverless method, you wont need to launch your own servers for hosting or even for the automated flow.

If you donâ€™t know about Netlify, it is a platform where static websites can be deployed easily without worrying about launching any servers. Below flow architecture can help explain the overall functionality.
